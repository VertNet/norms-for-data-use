# VertNet Norms for Data Use and Publication

## Purpose

[This repository](https://github.com/VertNet/norms-for-data-use) contains the norms for data use and publication for data publishers and data users of the VertNet network.  These norms were adapted from the [Canadensys](http://www.canadensys.net) Norms for data use and publication, <http://www.canadensys.net/norms>.

These norms are not a legal document. They are a well-considered code of conduct that anyone who publishes data to or uses data downloaded from VertNet are expected to uphold to build a vibrant community intended to support efforts to make biodiversity data as complete, discoverable, and accessible as possible.

## Fork us

By hosting [these norms on Github in Markdown format](https://github.com/VertNet/norms-for-data-use/blob/master/norms.md), we encourage others to fork and adap them for their own needs and we can keep track history of these revisions. Thus, we strongly encourage others, especially those working with open data, to use this document.
